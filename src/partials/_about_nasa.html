<p>MODIS - Displays information on fire locations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire detection data.  MODIS fire detection data for the current year are compiled Terra and Aqua MODIS fire and thermal anomalies data. The MODIS instrument images the entire surface of the Earth every two days (daily in northern latitudes), making observations in 36 co-registered spectral bands at moderate spatial resolutions (250, 500, and 1000 meters). Thermal information is collected at 1000-meter spatial resolution. The collected thermal information is converted to ellipse-shaped vector polygons. These collections are processed through the MODLand Rapid Response System using the algorithm described by the MOD14 Users Guide. The thermal MODIS data is shown by the color of the symbol on the map. This thermal data is collected twice a day, at 2:00 PM EST and again at 12:00 AM EST and are then processed and merged into a single map, which is available by 3:00 AM EST. Identification of a MODIS pixel as "fire" in this layer does not necessarily mean that the entire area represented by the pixel is on fire. The identification of a fire can be the result of a hot fire in a relatively small area, or a cooler fire over a larger area. At this time, there is no way to discriminate between these two possibilities. The geolocation of the centroid of the fire pixel is within one-half of one pixel (500-meters) of the location shown on the map.</p>
<p>VIIRS-I - The VIIRS 375 m (VNP14IMGTDL_NRT) active fire product is the latest product to be added to FIRMS. It provides data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite. The 375 m data complements MODIS fire detections; they both show good agreement in hotspot detection but the improved spatial resolution of the 375 m data provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas and provides improved mapping of large fire perimeters. The 375 m data also has improved nighttime performance. Consequently, these data are well suited for use in support of fire management (e.g., near real-time alert systems), as well as other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity. The VIIRS IBAND layer is updated every two hours.</p>
<p>Data is refreshed every hour.</p>
<p>The data should be in the correct dated file based on when the satellites and/or NASA acquired the data.</p>
