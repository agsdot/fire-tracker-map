<p>The <a href="https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/active_fire/c6/text/MODIS_C6_USA_contiguous_and_Hawaii_7d.csv" target="_blank">Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)</a> displays fire detection data. MODIS data for the current year are compiled via MODIS satellites Terra and Aqua for fire and thermal anomalies data. The MODIS instrument captures images of the surface of the Earth every two days, daily in northern latitudes, making observations in 36 co-registered spectral bands at moderate spatial resolutions (250, 500 and 1,000 meters). Thermal information is collected at 1,000-meter spatial resolution. The collected thermal information is converted to ellipse-shaped vector polygons. These collections are processed through the MODLand Rapid Response System using the algorithm described by the MOD14 Users Guide. The thermal MODIS data is shown by the color of the symbol on the map. This thermal data are collected twice a day, at 11 a.m. and 9 p.m. PST, and are processed and merged into a single map, which is available by midnight PST. The identification of a MODIS pixel as "fire" in this layer does not necessarily mean the entire area represented by the pixel is on fire. The identification of a fire can be the result of a hot fire in a relatively small area or a cooler fire over a larger area. At this time, there is no way to discriminate between these two possibilities. The geolocation of the centroid of the fire pixel is within one-half of one pixel (500-meters) of the location shown on the map.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/active_fire/viirs/text/VNP14IMGTDL_NRT_USA_contiguous_and_Hawaii_7d.csv" target="_blank">VIIRS 375m (VNP14IMGTDL_NRT) active fire product</a> is the latest update to be added to the Fire Information for Resource Management System. It provides data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS-I) sensor aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite. The 375m data complements MODIS fire detections; they both show agreement in hot spot detection but the improved spatial resolution of the 375m data provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas and provides improved mapping of large fire perimeters. The 375m data also has improved nighttime performance. Consequently, these data are well-suited for use in support of fire management, such as real-time alert systems, as well as in other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity. The VIIRS IBAND layer is updated every two hours.</p>
