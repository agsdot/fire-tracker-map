<p>Fire perimeters are based on infrared and thermal imaging from NASA's MODIS and VIIRS-I products.</p>

<p>The perimeters are intended to provide a picture of the scope and extent of the fires in California, as well as parts of Nevada and Oregon, with the most current data possible. They are an approximation and do not include all areas affected by fire, nor do they indicate with certainty an area was affected. CalFire and others use this data to help identify fires and their hot spots.  But because of the distance of the satellites, the nature of the measurements and obfuscation by smoke, the resolution is coarse and not 100 percent accurate.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.geomac.gov/viewer/help/modis_active.html" target="_blank">Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)</a> displays fire detection data and uses fire and thermal anomalies data compiled via MODIS satellites Terra and Aqua. Thermal information is collected at 1,000-meter spatial resolution. The identification of a "fire" by MODIS does not necessarily mean the entire area represented is on fire. The identification of a fire can be the result of a hot fire in a relatively small area or a cooler fire over a larger area. At this time, there is no way to discriminate between these two possibilities.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.geomac.gov/viewer/help/viirs_active.html" target="_blank">Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS-I)</a> provides data from sensors aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite. The 375-meter spatial resolution provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas and provides improved mapping of large fire perimeters. VIIRS-I also has improved nighttime performance.</p>
