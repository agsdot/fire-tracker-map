<p>Air quality data is from <a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/air-quality-real-time-map/" target="_blank">Berkeley Earth air quality map</a> and is not available at high resolutions of the map. We refresh the data every 30 minutes and it is a few hours behind real time.</p>
<p>The map shows concentrations of air pollution particulates that are less than 2.5 microns in diameter, which is a primary concern for peopleâ€™s health at high levels. Pollution estimates are based on measurements from thousands of stations around the world, which are interpolated.</p>
