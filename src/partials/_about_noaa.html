<p>Hot spots are locations identified by satellite analysts from the <a href="http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/land/fire/fire.kml" target="_blank">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</a> based on various types of imaging. The NOAA file is updated between 5 a.m. and 7 p.m. PST every 30 minutes, and otherwise as time permits. Hot spots should be considered points with no radius or resolution. The current map may contain hot spots up to 48 hours old.</p>
<p>Heliophysics Modeling and Simulation (HMS) is an interactive processing system that allows researchers in the Satellite Analysis Branch to integrate data from algorithms used in satellite systems including Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, Polar, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Fire Algorithm, and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System images. The result is a quality-controlled display of the locations of fires and significant smoke plumes detected by meteorological satellites.</p>
