<p>Hot spots are locations identified by satellite analysts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>

<p>The hot spots are an approximation and do not include all areas affected by fire, nor do they indicate with certainty an area was affected. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) and others use this data to help identify fires and the hot spots. Because of the distance of the satellites, the nature of the measurements and obfuscation by smoke, the resolution is coarse and not 100 percent accurate.</p>

<p>NOAA's <a href="http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/land/hms.html" target="_blank">Hazard Mapping System Fire and Smoke Product (HMS)</a> is based on locations of fires and significant smoke plumes detected by meteorological satellites. The data is updated between 5 a.m. and 7 p.m. every 30 minutes, and otherwise as time permits. Hot spots should be considered points with no radius or resolution. The current map may contain hot spots up to 48 hours old.</p>
