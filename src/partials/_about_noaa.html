<p>NOAA hotspot data is based on <a href="http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/land/fire/fire.kml" target="_blank">NOAA data</a>.</p>
<p>The HMS is an interactive processing system that allows the trained satellite analysts in the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), within the Satellite Services Division (SSD), to manually integrate data from various automated fire detection algorithms with GOES and polar (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Fire Algorithm (MODIS) and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS)) images. The result is a quality controlled display of the locations of fires and significant smoke plumes detected by meteorological satellites.</p>
